Ironically, I am starting another post saying I'm now working a new job (which is how the last post started)... and thats a big contributing factor to not posting a lot. I hope to do better on a lot of fronts in my life and 1 of them is to post my thoughts to out to the ether a bit more. 
Luckily I am still traveling and couchsurfing and trying to live my best life. Recently I couchsurfed in Cuidad de Mexico for the CouchCrash and WOW! what an experience.  I can't put in the words all the people i met who showed me a lot of love. Heres a small list (Phil, Manasi, Micah, Sarah, Pedro, Alejandra, Joza, Steph, Angie, Scott, Robbie). I'll try to highlight a few things I enjoyed. 

### Background
I had visited Mexico City once when I was really young and the only thing I recall was the smog coming in on the plane. Not to fret I was not let down in that regard and saw plenty more ;).

Over a couple years, I have managed to make a few friends around the US couchsurfing. We all live in separate states but are able to visit each other often. Since we all met at CouchCrashes we thought it would be cool to all go to CDMX for theirs. Now I have minor stereotypes about what Mexico is supposed to be but I was blown away by the kindness, culture, and the food. I can't wait go go back (Tulum and Chiapas are NEXT!). Shout-out to my Hosts Alejandra and Joza -- some real salt of the earth people.

### Arrival 
The first thing i was struck with was how fucking huge Mexico City is. Its so hard to conceptualize in your head, its like trying to comprehend the vast size of the universe -- our monkey brains just can't process it. Sure I know Cuidad de Mexico is the biggest city in North America but the vastness really took me back a bit and put things in perspective. It was a very nice time to arrive from the cold in Chicago since Spring has actually started. These beautiful purple trees called Jacarandas that look similar to cherry blossoms had just started blooming when I arrived which really added a nice atmosphere to the city (again not something I would associate with Mexico but hey thats my American ignorance I suppose).

Once I made my way to my hosts place and got settled my first truly 'Mexican experience' happended -- it involved the water and no I wasn't dumb enough to drink it (almost). The city was doing some major construction on their street which had in turn knocked off all the water on the block. All showers from then on were hobo style with baby wipes and buckets of water. Alejendra joked with me that it was similar to staying at her Abuelas house (where there is still no running water). I'm not a picky person and persevered. 

### Teotihuacan
I woke up at 6am to go visit Teotihuacan after a heavy night of drinking. It wasn't so easy getting up and learned the hard lesson of Tiempo Mexicano. 'Mexican Time' is a cultural pain point where everything is perpetually 30-45 mins late. It took us awhile to heard the troops together and get to and find a rental van we intended to take one hour outside of town to see the famous pyramids. Despite this and it being hot as well, It was absolutely worth the sun burn, rough hangover, and snags:

### Trajineras en Xochimilco
Xochimilco is a borough south of Mexico City mostly known for the colorful gondola style boats called trajineras. These wooden boats are hand-painted in bright colours and float along an intricate system of canals. There is an undeniable festive atmosphere at Xochimilco. Each trajinera fits up up to 20 boats. Food boats and mariachi also zip through the canal providing entertainment -- however most of the couchsurfing entertainment came from drinking. We had 5 boats in our group creating quite the overall atmosphere:
