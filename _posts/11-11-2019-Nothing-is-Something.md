title: Nothing is Something Worth Doing

I will soon be taking the blog back to the regularly programming... yep you guessed it - travel updates. I have a lot to say about my travels especially with Erdogan, Trump, and the Kurds being in the news recently. I suppose that’s old news now when you look to Bolivia, Chile, or Hong Kong! 

("May you live in interesting times indeed") 

I digress… After being home for ~1.5 months I fell back into the same old habits some of which are helpful and the others not so much. A vacation only relieves the stress from work temporarily just to blast you twice as hard when you re-enter the atmosphere.  Being a Sysadmin is basically just an exercise in managing stressors and complexity. Its very easy to get quickly jaded or overwhelmed (which coincidently seems to be why many IT professionals drink A LOT). I noticed myself having snap reactions to many things and getting angry at tickets coming my way when I came back. The engineer in me wanted to tell people why they were wrong when they suggested bad technical idea – great way to win friends btw. 

Why? I assume most people in this position didn’t get here by luck but by sweat and tears identifying problems/solutions and executing quickly. Culturally we seem very prone here in the States to take issue with sitting still – doubly so when facing problems. Generally, my reaction is to automatically respond to incoming problems. This has made me not act strategically or fully rationally. Strategy is about choice and trying to fix all problems is the antithesis of choice as you may fix nothing.  

A certain level of mindfulness can be achieved through this as well by removing the engineer, the emotion, and the desire to be right. As counterintuitive as it is many times the right answer is to do absolutely nothing, the best move is not to play, or in other words nothing is something worth doing.
