title: Folding for COVID-19

I have been sitting at home trying to find a way to help contribute to the worldwide effort against COVID-19 beyond just staying inside. Its a little odd thinking other generations had to be sent off to war as their great test and ours is just sit at home watching Netflix or playing games. I've only really been able to check in with my neighbors and offer any extra supplies I have. My aunt on my mom's side is sowing masks for nurses / paramedics in Virginia to offer when PPE runs low. She's already made hundreds of masks so I really felt like I wasn't doing enough. I'm an asthmatic so I'm at higher risk for any respiratory virus so I've been trying to find the answer to these feelings without exposing myself outside. 

The universe has provided an answer to me this weekend combining my interests in computer hardware (specifically GPUs), Linux, and crypto currency. If you look back at the sparse posts on this blog from 2017 I was discussing automating the setup of crypto miners. Quarantined in the house I have been talking with people I haven't had chances to connect with in some time including many people involved with crypto mining. They informed me that researchers at Stanford have created a distributing computing project called Folding@home [F@H](https://foldingathome.org/) to perform molecular dynamics simulations of proteins. Generally this has focused on protein folding but quickly shifted to researching other biomedical problems like cancer and Alzheimers disease. During the Obama era they shifted further to examining Eola and other infectious diseases. Of course amid the COVID-19 pandemic they have turned their computing resources towards assisting researchers to finding a cure for COVID-19 by simulating potentially druggable proteins from the virus. 

Perhaps a greater commentary is needed on the implications of this but as I dug deeper I noticed that the founders of massive crypto farms mining for profit decided to switch over to exclusively contribute massive amounts of computing power. Its amazing that people are coming together in nerdy distributed ways to help in their own way. In fact participation in F@H has increased 1200% in the last couple weeks increasing the computing power to 470 petaFLOPS. They went from 30k participants to 430k. To put that in perspective the largest supercomputer - IBM summit is benchmarked at 148.6 petaFLOPS. F@H is now the world largest super computering network by a wide margin. Its actually more than the top 7 in the world, AMAZING! Summit is also [tasked ](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/19/us/fastest-supercomputer-coronavirus-scn-trnd/index.html)with identifying chemicals that could stop coronavirus from spreading.

I was/am totally awestruck by this. As people come together through hard times in person they are also coming together virtually to tackle this problem. Even in the face of massive uncertainty and volatility miners are foregoing their income to contribute to something bigger than themselves. Human nature and all that... It wasn't a question of should I do it, it was how can i get this stood up ASAP. I have many crypto mining GPU rigs sitting around that paid themselves off a couple of years ago that are now sitting idle as they were no longer profitable(pic below of sad miners):

Iâ€™m proud to say that now I have 17 GPUs contributing to the project. There is no guarantee what the results of the experiments will yield but its a very interesting opportunity for scientists to throw everything they have at this pandemic. Many countries have had leaked documents come out saying the crisis will likely last 18 months. In my mind that alone makes it seem high level officials are banking on a vaccine or treatment. There are plenty of stories in the news of people becoming reinfected. Whilst I cannot contribute on the order of magnitude of a giant Ethereum mining farm I'm happy to be playing some part in this. 

F@H has already made tangible results in other areas and makes thier data publically available to other researchers:
