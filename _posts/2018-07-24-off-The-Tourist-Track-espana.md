title: Off The Tourist Track (en Espana)
---

Off the bat, apologies for not posting in a long time. Its been a life whirlwind between purchasing a house, a new job, and traveling. I've been saving this blog post for awhile. 

### The Idea 
After hosting numerous people on couchsurfing over the years, I decided to do a Europe trip mostly in former soviet block countries (in this instance the [Visegrad group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visegr%C3%A1d_Group)). However, some of my favorite couchsurfers of all time who live in Huesca, Spain (a small town near the Pyrenees mountains) had extended an open invite to me. I decided to take them up on it and travel there on the last leg of my journey. I skipped the tourist track in Barcelona and boarded the first train to Zaragoza. I was joined by some of their family and they took me in as one of their own. Muchas gracias Javi, Vanessa, Pepe, Humberto, and Laura!!! Espero ver a todos de nuevo

The only picture I have of us is in Go Tavern in Logan Square when they surfed with me:

### Huesca
I arrived in the early afternoon and was immediately greeted with some Gazpacho and Ensaladilla Rusa (Russian Salad) which is evidently pretty popular in Spain. I also tried an extremely potent blue goat cheese that could likely take the paint off a boat. I ate the lions share like a savage (and you have to be to eat blue cheese in the first place).

After catching up, It was time for a small siesta and then we went out to get some traditional Huesca tapas. My memory is a bit blurry here between the beer and Orujo and I took no pictures (killing it). The only things I can distinctly remember eating were pig snout and croquetas which were equally delicious. From Huesca it was off to Jaca and then the Pyrenees.

### Jaca
We arrived in the early afternoon on our way to Aratores (where my friends have a cabin) to pick up some supplies and have a look around. Jaca is the more touristic town (at least in relation to Huesca). It has two prominent buildings the San Pedro Citadel and the Jaca Cathedral. Built in the 16th and 10th (!) century respectively. I believe the cathedral is the oldest one standing on the Iberian Peninsula. There was not a soul inside when I visited making it a bit eerie with an ancient vibe.

*This is the only photo that isn't mine. There was too much light coming in to get a good picture while I was there.* 

At this time in Jaca there was a town wide celebration happening (Think Carnival). This happens every year across most towns in Spain (the one in Huesca was the week after). This was a very interesting thing to witness as a foreigner, each part of the town dressed in their neighborhood colors and had designated leaders leading them (with drinks, and instruments!). Heck even Ned Flanders made an appearance!

### The Pyrenees
My gracious hosts took me to the Ibon De Estanes. This is a lake in the mountains right on the border with France. Its an 11km hike round trip and that wraps around back through France(Thank goodness for the Shenegen zone!). I don't really think my words can do it justice so I'll just leave some pictures.

### The Renfe 
The Renfe is the train system throughout Spain (both the regional bullet trains and standard metro rails). The train no longer runs into France. My understanding is that a train derailed in the 70s which demolished a key bridge. France never rebuilt it since it was under some financial pressure. Since it was built under Franco-Spanish international convention it did remain opened during WW2 which provided an escape route for some jews and allied soldiers.

This is the station Canfrac which is somewhat famous: [further reading](http://www.forbidden-places.net/urban-exploration-canfranc-railway-station#1)

Since I love trains, my friends thought it would be a good idea to drop me off at the most remote station and to to just meet them back in Huesca. I agreed full heartedly and was dropped off at a station called Castiello; I was the lone passenger.  My limited spanish got me a ticket but It was hard to understand much more ("Yo necesito comprar una etiqueta castiello a huesca!").

The conductor explained to me in very fast Spanish that we were changing trains in Huesca (my final destination) and it took me about 3 times to fully understand with my American ignorance creeping in. Luckily I didn't have to deal with this situation and was able to get back in one piece whilist getting a nice mountain view.

Despite the hike kicking my out of shape ass, overall it was one the best experiences I have ever had.
